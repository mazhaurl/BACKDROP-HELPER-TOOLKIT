Im happy to introduce the Backdrop Helper Toolkit, 
an enhanced version of my previous Backdrop Helper tool for Nuke! 

This new toolkit comes with some fantastic features designed to streamline your workflow:

   1. 56 Unique Color Presets with manual color pick options ðŸŽ¨
  
   2. One-click fill or border selection
  
   3. Add label text and adjust its size
  
   4. Easily adjust the size of the backdrop

The original Backdrop Helper allowed users to generate backdrops with predefined labels for various VFX stages like 'Alpha,' '3D,' and 'Cleanup,' with colors tailored to each stage.

Now, the toolkit takes it a step further with even more customization options!

And the best part? This toolkit will work with any backdrop, even ones you create manually!
